| Course | Description | Course Length |
|-----|----------|---------|
| [What is Artificial Intelligence? (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=27394) | This is an introductory course on artificial intelligence (AI). In the course, we discuss what AI is and why it is important, and take a brief look at machine learning and deep learning—which are subsets of AI—and describe how Amazon uses AI in its products.) | 10 minutes |
| [AWS Foundations: Machine Learning Basics (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=49644) | What is machine learning? How can machine learning solve business problems? When is it appropriate to use a machine learning model? What are the phases of a machine learning pipeline? In this course, you get an overview of the concepts, terminology, and processes of the exciting field of machine learning! | 30 minutes |
| [AWS Foundations: How Amazon SageMaker Can Help (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/Video?id=49646) | Learn how Amazon SageMaker mitigates the core challenges of implementing a machine learning pipeline. In this course, you learn how SageMaker notebooks and instances help power your machine learning workloads and review the key Amazon SageMaker features. | 30 minutes |
| [ML Building Blocks: Services and Terminology (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=27242) | These two courses clarify both the machine learning stack and the terms and processes that will help you build a good foundation in machine learning. You’ll explore the AWS ML stack through application use cases, platform services, frameworks, interfaces, and infrastructure. You’ll also learn how a business problem becomes a machine learning problem, and how data is moved and processed throughout the pipeline to train models and create predictions. | 40 minutes |
| [Developing Machine Learning Applications (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=27243) | In this curriculum, we’ll explore Amazon’s fully managed ML platform, Amazon SageMaker. Specifically, we’ll discuss how to train and tune models, how certain algorithms are built in, how you can bring your own algorithm, and how to build for particular use cases like recommender systems or anomaly detection. | 2 hours |
| [AWS DeepRacer: Driven by Reinforcement Learning (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=32143) | This course is designed to give you hands-on experience with reinforcement learning (RL) by helping you build, train and deploy models in AWS DeepRacer so you can compete in the official AWS DeepRacer League. The course starts off by orienting you to AWS DeepRacer before diving into RL. You’ll have several opportunities to build, train, and evaluate your own RL models, and then deploy them to the physical car. By the end of the course, you’ll have your own optimized RL model that you can enter into a virtual or physical circuit of the AWS DeepRacer League. | 90 minutes |
| [Worker Safety Project with AWS DeepLens (Free)](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=32077) | This intermediate-level course is designed to help you dust off your AWS DeepLens device and move from AWS DeepLens inquirer to practitioner. The course will help you get there by walking you through an object detection project that in the end will be able to identify individuals on a construction site who aren’t wearing hard hats. | 30 minutes |
| [AWS Computer Vision: Getting Started with GluonCV (Free)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-computer-vision-gluoncv) | 30 hours | 
| [Practical Data Science with Amazon SageMaker](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=40748) | In this course, learn how to solve a real-world use case with machine learning and produce actionable results using Amazon SageMaker. This course teaches you how to use Amazon SageMaker to cover the different stages of the typical data science process, from analyzing and visualizing a data set, to preparing the data and feature engineering, down to the practical aspects of model building, training, tuning and deployment. | 1 day |
| [The Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=38910) | This course explores how to use the machine learning (ML) pipeline to solve a real business problem in a project-based learning environment. Students will learn about each phase of the pipeline from instructor presentations and demonstrations and then apply that knowledge to complete a project solving one of three business problems: fraud detection, recommendation engines, or flight delays. By the end of the course, students will have successfully built, trained, evaluated, tuned, and deployed an ML model using Amazon SageMaker that solves their selected business problem. | 4 days |
| [Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty](https://www.aws.training/SessionSearch?pageNumber=1&courseId=10021) | The AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty exam validates a candidate's ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) solutions for given business problems. People with one to two years of experience developing, architecting, or running ML/DL workloads on the AWS cloud should join this workshop to learn how to prepare to successfully pass the exam. The workshop explores the exam’s topic areas, shows how they relate to machine learning on AWS, and also maps them to machine learning and deep learning foundational areas for future self-study. It includes sample exam questions from each domain and discussions of concepts being tested to help test-takers better eliminate incorrect responses. | 4 hours |
| [A Cloud Guru Online Course: AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty) | Preparation for the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty certification exam.| 18 hours |
