description = "Do you want to use computer vision in your projects, but find the idea of training a custom neural network model daunting? Have you used pre-trained computer vision models, but find that these models don’t cover every aspect of your use case? With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can easily customise existing computer vision models without needing an expert data scientist. Come learn how to prepare your dataset, customise Amazon Rekognition models with your data, and deploy these models in an application. We also discuss the difference between training computer vision models using Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels and doing so using Amazon SageMaker."
