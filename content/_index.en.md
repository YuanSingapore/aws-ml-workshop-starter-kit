## Welcome

Welcome to the **{{< param description >}}**. Virtual attendees can expect two days of AI/ML learning and community building. Thank you for joining us to dive deep into how AWS AI and ML services can help your businesses. 

Over the next two days you will have access to workshops, sessions, and events to help you gain an understanding of the AWS AI/ML service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of solutions that can be built using AWS AI/ML services.

The workshops and other hands-on content we will discuss are focused on **Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning in the Cloud** and they will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you'll face in building AI/ML solutions on AWS.
