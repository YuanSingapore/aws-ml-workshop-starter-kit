# AWS Public Sector AI/ML Virtual Loft

## Welcome
Welcome to the **{{< param description >}}**. Virtual attendees can participate in AI/ML 
learning and community building. Thank you for joining us to dive deep into how AWS AI and ML 
services can help your businesses. 

Over the  day you will have access to workshops, sessions, and events to help you gain 
an understanding of the AWS AI/ML service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of solutions 
that can be built using AWS AI/ML services.

The workshops and other hands-on content we will discuss are 
focused on **Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning in the Cloud** and they will guide you 
through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you'll face in 
building AI/ML solutions on AWS.
