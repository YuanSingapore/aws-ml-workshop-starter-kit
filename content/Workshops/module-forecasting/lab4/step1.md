The lab is split into four parts. After completing the first lab on data analysis, you can try the other labs in any order.

1. The first part of the lab will focus on exploring and preparing the data needed for the other lab sections.
2. The second part of the lab will explore using the RCF algorithm for anomaly detection.
3. The third part of the lab will explore using the DeepAR algorithm for anomaly detection.
4. The fourth part of the lab will explore using the Kinesis Data Analytics for anomaly detection.
