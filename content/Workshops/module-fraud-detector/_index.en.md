Globally each year, organizations lose tens of billions of dollars to online fraud. Amazon Fraud Detector is a fully managed service that makes it easy to identify potentially fraudulent online activities such as the creation of fake accounts or online payment fraud. Unlike general purpose machine learning solutions, Fraud Detector is designed specifically to detect fraud. Fraud Detector combines customer data with the latest in machine learning science and more than 20 years of fraud detection experience from Amazon.com and AWS. 

In the workshop, with watching a video and experimenting a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom5610/amazon-fraud-detector-workshop/blob/master/account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb), you will learn the process of:

1. Creating and deploying a detector API using sample data to train a machine learning model and business rules with Amazon Fraud Detector

2. Calling the detector API with test data to evaluating the results.

3. Seeing how adjusting the business rule thresholds can change the test results to suit the desired outcomes of the customer.
